# NYC_Job_Market_EDA_and_Predictive_Model

Introduction: We are currently seeking funding to support our research project, which focuses on the analysis of NYC Jobs Postings related trends using real-world data. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset containing information about job postings in New York City that includes information like job titles, salary ranges, and job descriptions. By using this dataset, our goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing the salary ranges in NYC.

Dataset: We have selected the " NYC Jobs Postings" dataset, accessible at the following URL: 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs
This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included.

Research Questions: Our project aims to address several key research questions:
1.	Find the best jobs by salary and company rating.
2.	Explore skills required in job descriptions.
3.	Explore the relationship between position type and salary range.
4.	Find the relationship between number of positions and salary range.
5.	Find distribution of salary ranges for different job categories and career levels.
6.	Predict salary based on industry, location, company revenue.

Dependent and Independent Variables: To explore these questions, we plan to treat the following variables as dependent and independent variables:

Dependent Variable (DV):
1.	Number of Positions: This could be a DV if you're interested in predicting the demand for positions based on certain factors.
2.	Salary Range From/To: Predicting salary ranges based on various job characteristics.
3.	Posting Type: Analyzing the type of postings based on certain features.

Independent Variables (IV):
1.	Agency: Analyzing differences in job postings among different agencies.
2.	Business Title/Civil Service Title: Exploring how job titles relate to other variables.
3.	Job Category: Investigating patterns within different job categories.
4.	Work Location/Work Location 1: Understanding how job locations impact other variables.
5.	Minimum Qual Requirements/Preferred Skills: Analyzing the qualifications and skills required for different positions.

Model/Algorithm: As of now as per our analysis or getting the overview of data, we would like to proceed with either of the below. Then depending on the further exploration, we will decide the model/algorithm.
•	Random Forest Regression (Preferred)
•	Gradient Boosting Regression (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
•	Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Conclusion: In conclusion, with your generous support, our project will shed light on the dynamics of job postings in New York City. Through this project, we seek to provide valuable information for job seekers, employers, and policymakers in NYC. Our findings could help job seekers make informed decisions about job opportunities and salary expectations, while also assisting employers in tailoring their recruitment strategies to attract qualified candidates. We kindly seek your financial assistance to aid us in pursuing these significant research inquiries.
